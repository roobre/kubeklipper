# You probably want change this to something that is not an emptyDir.
# As of 5.6.0-ls11, the container does not appropriately set permissions for cura to be able to this directory. You will
# need to manually chown the directories cura writes to:
# chown -R 911 /config/.local/share/cura
# chown -R 911 /config/.config/cura
